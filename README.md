# 100DaysOfCode Challenge APP1 Frontend

## Purpose

This project will be a React rework version of an old app of mine. The first one lacked a lot of features and polishing. It was barely a backbone app. Since it was going to be use by a single person, it didn't matter if it looked good or not. But it is not possible to add that app into my portfolio in that state, so I decided to remake it a while ago but couldn't spare the time to start it.

After commiting myself 100 Days of Code Challenge, I decided that I can use that min 1 hour of challenge coding for my personal projects. Here we go.

# Daily Logs

## Day 0:

It was kind of a last minute commit just to fulfill my daily goal. I spent my day traveling mostly.

Since this app will be a mock version of the real one, I decided that I can have a semi-public API on the backend (I don't want it to be spammed by nsfw stuff, so I would rather make Create route require auth).

Established remote DB connection, and played around a little bit about how to handle queries. I'm not completely sure yet, so I will code min requirements tomorrow and than hop into the frontend. I want this to be something different than the previous version, I want to practice new designs.
