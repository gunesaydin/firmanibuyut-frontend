# 100DaysOfCode Challenge APP1 Frontend

## Purpose

This project will be a React rework version of an old app of mine. The first one lacked a lot of features and polishing. It was barely a backbone app. Since it was going to be use by a single person, it didn't matter if it looked good or not. But it is not possible to add that app into my portfolio in that state, so I decided to remake it a while ago but couldn't spare the time to start it.

After commiting myself 100 Days of Code Challenge, I decided that I can use that min 1 hour of challenge coding for my personal projects. Here we go.

# Daily Logs

## Day 0:

It was kind of a last minute commit just to fulfill my daily goal. I spent my day traveling mostly.

Since this app will be a mock version of the real one, I decided that I can have a semi-public API on the backend (I don't want it to be spammed by nsfw stuff, so I would rather make Create route require auth).

Established remote DB connection, and played around a little bit about how to handle queries. I'm not completely sure yet, so I will code min requirements tomorrow and than hop into the frontend. I want this to be something different than the previous version, I want to practice new designs.

## Day 1:

Created React frontend of my app. Mainly spent time roughly designing its architecture, then styling and navbar component.

I was not in a comfortable working environment, and it effects my productivity.

## Day 2:

Added footer and login components to my frontend. Considered bootstrap and semantic for styling, but decided to go with styling components on my own. I lack CSS skills and it becomes such a huge burden for me every time, why not challenge myself and learn it?

Again, I had to work outside. I was able to consantrate a little better today, but still I would prefer my own desk. Hopefully I will be able to work from my desktop tomorrow.
